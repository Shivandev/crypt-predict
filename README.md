ðŸŒ¿ Replit Branch
The actual live app codeâ€”developed and deployed through Replitâ€”is housed in the replit branch. This branch includes the production-ready scripts, UI integration, and backend logic tailored for real-time usage. It is structurally separate from the main branch to ensure clean development workflows and reduce clutter from testing notebooks.

ðŸ”„ Purpose of Structure
Main Branch: Focused on research, ideation, and code exploration.

Replit Branch: Contains the deployable app version, optimized and cleaned up for live environments.

By maintaining this structure, we ensure a balance between transparency (through shared learning material) and clean production code (in the app branch).
